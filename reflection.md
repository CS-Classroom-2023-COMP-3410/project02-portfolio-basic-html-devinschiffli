During the development of my website I first brainstormed what I wanted the end product to look like and made a rough sketch of that and all the features I wanted to include. The hardest part was definetly remembering how to format everything without constantly flipping back to the notes, but once I got past the home page I feel like I was able to do the rest with minimal help from notes. Outside of that I ran into an issue when I was about to submit because I forgot to put everything into directories so I had to go and rename all the relative paths for photos and links. Overall, I really enjoyed this assignment especially since I was able to check my progress while I was coding and see the visual element of what I was writing instead of just writing hundreds of lines of code then checking the output when I run the program.
